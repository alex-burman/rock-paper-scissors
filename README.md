This is my version of the Rock Paper Scissors game created for The Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/rock-paper-scissors


This project accomplished the following:

1. Demonstrated an understanding of Javascript by creating the basic functionality and logic of the Rock Paper Scissors game

2. Demonstrated an understanding of DOM manipulation using JavaScript by adding, removing, and modifying HTML elements to create the interface and display information relating to the Rock Paper Scissors game.
